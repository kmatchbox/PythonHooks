Script Name: Collect Media
Script Version: 1.0
Flame Version: 2023
Author: Kyle Obley (info@kyleobley.com)

Creation Date: 10.08.21
Modification Date: 07.12.25

Description:

    Dump a list of every non-cached clip and segment in every sequence and batch in every folder
    out to a known location for archiving.

Change Log:

    v1.0: Merged Chris' 0.9.2 but changed the logic to not include a dated sub-folder for easier backups.

          Re-incorperated the ability for a custom save location.

    v0.9.2: Changed output location to ~/collect_media/{project_name}/{YYYYMMDD}/ for easier access
            and to avoid permission issues. Organized by project and date for better management.
            Fixes FileNotFoundError by automatically creating directory structure.

    v0.9: Added a timestamped backup of a previoous list if found if, for whatever reason, you need to roll-back.

    v0.8: Stopped using a UniqueList for all the lists and instead us set() at the end to remove duplicates due to a
          the previous method taking significantly longer. Resulted in a 1000x speed increase. Bonkers.

    v0.7: Attempting to speed up the write process for large projects.

    v0.6: Fixed the handling of Red files to go up on directory to ensure we grab all the sub-files.

          Added ability to specify a custom dump file location (custom_dump_location).

    v0.5: Added the option to scrape cached media as well.

          Added more checks during scraping to avoid NoneTypes. Not sure if it's bulletproof though.

    v0.4: PySegment.source_cached added to API allowing us the ability to now get the cached
          status of clips in segments including audio.

          Set the minimum version to 2023.1

          Removed Python 2.7 support as we now require 2023

          Added a warning and completion dialog using the built-in message display

    v0.3: Current desktop is now scrapped as well.

          Adjusted the logic to how to account for the totals to reflect de-deplication
          and give a better impression of total number of file sequences.

    v0.2: Added compatability for Python 2.7

          Implemented a class to create a unique list as opposed to dumping everything
          to a list and then using sort to de-dup. Written by Clauss.

          Re-worked logic of how we manage an existing list.

          Added audio support. Cached status within a sequence is still an issue.

    v0.1: Initial Release

Important / Cavets:
    - We can not see into BFX so anything in there will not be caught.
    - This will only grab the used version of a versioned clip, not every version.
    - This will only grab the latest batch iteration, not previous versions.
    - Within batch, only import nodes are seen, not read file nodes.
    - Only works on the current workspace.
    - Flame returns the path of an image sequence as the first frame in the sequence, not the first frame being
      used within said image sequence. For now the safest route is to find the last frame in the sequence on disk
      and use that to populate the list.

To Do:
    - Figure out how to dig into batch iteration reels
