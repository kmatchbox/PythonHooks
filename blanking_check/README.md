# Blanking Check

Adds a blanking check adjustment layer that adds the "idEdgy" matchbox and then a 2D transform to scale the underlying image down. There is also an option to remove the layer that was created when you've finished checking all of your sequences.

This DOES NOT account for letterboxes.

### How To Use:
1. Select sequences.
2. Right-click > QC Tools > Add Blanking Check (or Remove to remove)
