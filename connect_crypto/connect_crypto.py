Script Name: Connect Cryptomatte
Script Version: 0.5
Flame Version: 2021
Author: Kyle Obley (info@kyleobley.com)

Creation date: 05.07.23
Modified date: 26.02.24

Description:

    Creates and connect a Cryptomatte node to a read file node if it's a cryptomatte.

Change Log:

    v0.5: Completely changed logic to use node.output_sockets which removes the need to try channels, etc.
          This hopefully makes the script bulletproof.

    v0.4: Added support for channels coming out without the filename within the channel itself.

    v0.3: Added support for Houdini's Object ID naming

    v0.2: Added logic for different channel names and support for CryptoMesh

    v0.1: Initial Release
