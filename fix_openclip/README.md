# Fix openClip Name

Often Flame will use <shot name> or <batch iteration> as the entry for <name> in the openClip file. When you re-import said openClip the name that appers within Flame is whatever <name> is as opposed to the acutal file name of the .clip. This is not ideal for those who use only shot numbers for <shot name> as opposed to whatever_#### or if you want the name to not be stuck to the first iteration you exported.

### How To Use:
1. Select the openClip(s) in the Media Panel
2. Right-click > Fix openClip > Fix openClip Name

### What It Does
Replaces the existing <name> field with the basename of the .clip
