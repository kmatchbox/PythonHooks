# Social Versions

Many of us live in a world now where we have to create these timelines for every project.

Sadly, duplicating a timeline and reformatting it kills any connect segments you might have which makes that method not ideal.

Creating empty timelines in the new resolution, dragging the 16x9 timeline into that and naming it all…maybe fine for one or two edits but if you have a ton, that’s a lot of wasted time.

Here’s a hook that’ll do it all for you…other than the unicorn of re-racking but life can’t be all sunshine and butterflies.

### How To Use:
1. Select sequence(s)
2. Right-click > Social Versions
3. Select which of the 3 flavors
4. Let it run
5. Use any of the amazing renaming tools to re-jig the name to your workflow

### What It Does:
1. Creates a new reel named after the format you're creating (i.e. 1x1).
2. Creates a new timeline with the existing name but with the format name appended unless 16x9 exists within the sequence name. In that case it will replace 16x9 with the new format name.
3. Puts all the layers/versions from the selected sequence into the new one.
4. Saves you a ton of time.
